1
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,476
Since 2009, the world has been stuck

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,636
on a single narrative around a coming global food crisis

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,100
and what we need to do to avoid it.

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,220
How do we feed nine billion people by 2050?

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,876
Every conference, podcast and dialogue around global food security

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,596
starts with this question

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,356
and goes on to answer it

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,820
by saying we need to produce 70 percent more food.

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,796
The 2050 narrative started to evolve

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,700
shortly after global food prices hit all-time highs in 2008.

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,036
People were suffering and struggling,

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,596
governments and world leaders

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,236
needed to show us that they were paying attention

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,860
and were working to solve it.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,356
The thing is, 2050 is so far into the future

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,380
that we can't even relate to it,

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,836
and more importantly,

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,116
if we keep doing what we're doing,

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,500
it's going to hit us a lot sooner than that.

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,180
I believe we need to ask a different question.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,436
The answer to that question

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,020
needs to be framed differently.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,676
If we can reframe the old narrative

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,156
and replace it with new numbers

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,260
that tell us a more complete pictures,

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,716
numbers that everyone can understand

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,940
and relate to,

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,820
we can avoid the crisis altogether.

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,236
I was a commodities trader in my past life

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,436
and one of the things that I learned trading

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,340
is that every market has a tipping point,

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,756
the point at which change occurs so rapidly

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,636
that it impacts the world

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,620
and things change forever.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,500
Think of the last financial crisis,

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,300
or the dot-com crash.

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,060
So here's my concern.

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,636
We could have a tipping point

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,796
in global food and agriculture

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,715
if surging demand

41
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,140
surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food.

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,796
This means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,076
despite exploding prices,

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,180
unless we can commit to some type of structural change.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,156
This time around,

46
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,756
it won't be about stock markets and money.

47
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,156
It's about people.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,580
People could starve and governments may fall.

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,556
This question of at what point does supply struggle

50
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,236
to keep up with surging demand

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,916
is one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading

52
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,716
and became an absolute obsession.

53
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,676
It went from interest to obsession

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,356
when I realized through my research how broken the system was

55
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,700
and how very little data was being used to make such critical decisions.

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,716
That's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,236
and start an entrepreneurial journey

58
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,220
to start Gro Intelligence.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,196
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data

60
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,476
and doing the work to make it actionable,

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
to empower decision-makers at every level.

62
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,316
But doing this work,

63
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,596
we also realized that the world,

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,276
not just world leaders,

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,556
but businesses and citizens like every single person in this room,

66
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,660
lacked an actionable guide

67
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,196
on how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis.

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,236
And so we built a model,

69
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,156
leveraging the petabytes of data we sit on,

70
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,580
and we solved for the tipping point.

71
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,996
Now, no one knows we've been working on this problem

72
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,620
and this is the first time that I'm sharing what we discovered.

73
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,660
We discovered that the tipping point is actually a decade from now.

74
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,436
We discovered that the world

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,820
will be short 214 trillion calories

76
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,219
by 2027.

77
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,060
The world is not in a position to fill this gap.

78
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,820
Now, you'll notice

79
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,076
that the way I'm framing this is different from how I started,

80
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,236
and that's intentional, because until now

81
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,476
this problem has been quantified using mass:

82
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,316
think kilograms, tons, hectograms,

83
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,420
whatever your unit of choice is in mass.

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,700
Why do we talk about food in terms of weight?

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,596
Because it's easy.

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,116
We can look at a photograph and determine tonnage on a ship

87
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,396
by using a simple pocket calculator.

88
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,180
We can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts.

89
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,740
But what we care about in food is nutritional value.

90
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,996
Not all foods are created equal,

91
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,780
even if they weigh the same.

92
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,196
This I learned firsthand

93
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,220
when I moved from Ethiopia to the US for university.

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,156
Upon my return back home,

95
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,396
my father, who was so excited to see me,

96
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,020
greeted me by asking why I was fat.

97
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,556
Now, turns out that eating

98
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,436
approximately the same amount of food as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,

99
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,700
had actually lent a certain fullness to my figure.

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,676
This is why we should care about calories,

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,356
not about mass.

102
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,140
It is calories which sustain us.

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,516
So 214 trillion calories is a very large number,

104
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,676
and not even the most dedicated of us

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,636
think in the hundreds of trillions of calories.

106
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,780
So let me break this down differently.

107
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,036
An alternative way to think about this

108
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,916
is to think about it in Big Macs.

109
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,556
214 trillion calories.

110
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,796
A single Big Mac has 563 calories.

111
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,036
That means the world will be short 379 billion Big Macs in 2027.

112
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,060
That is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,836
So how did we get to these numbers in the first place?

114
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,060
They're not made up.

115
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,036
This map shows you where the world was 40 years ago.

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,076
It shows you net calorie gaps in every country in the world.

117
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,556
Now, simply put,

118
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,596
this is just calories consumed in that country

119
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,676
minus calories produced in that same country.

120
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,476
This is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else.

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,516
It's simply saying how many calories are consumed in a single year

122
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,396
minus how many are produced.

123
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,796
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,

124
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,196
or self-sufficient.

125
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,260
They have some in storage for a rainy day.

126
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,716
Red countries are net calorie importers.

127
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,676
The deeper, the brighter the red,

128
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,940
the more you're importing.

129
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,476
40 years ago, such few countries were net exporters of calories,

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,072
I could count them with one hand.

131
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,276
Most of the African continent,

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,916
Europe, most of Asia,

133
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,956
South America excluding Argentina,

134
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,700
were all net importers of calories.

135
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,000
And what's surprising is that China used to actually be food self-sufficient.

136
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,460
India was a big net importer of calories.

137
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,260
40 years later, this is today.

138
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,260
You can see the drastic transformation that's occurred in the world.

139
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,356
Brazil has emerged as an agricultural powerhouse.

140
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,636
Europe is dominant in global agriculture.

141
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,636
India has actually flipped from red to blue.

142
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,916
It's become food self-sufficient.

143
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,396
And China went from that light blue

144
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,060
to the brightest red that you see on this map.

145
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,460
How did we get here? What happened?

146
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,620
So this chart shows you India and Africa.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,580
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.

148
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,396
How is it that two regions that started off so similarly

149
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,556
in such similar trajectories

150
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,716
take such different paths?

151
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,780
India had a green revolution.

152
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,916
Not a single African country had a green revolution.

153
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,156
The net outcome?

154
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,876
India is food self-sufficient

155
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,276
and in the past decade has actually been exporting calories.

156
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,260
The African continent now imports over 300 trillion calories a year.

157
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,396
Then we add China, the green line.

158
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,100
Remember the switch from the blue to the bright red?

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,996
What happened and when did it happen?

160
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,876
China seemed to be on a very similar path to India

161
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,676
until the start of the 21st century,

162
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,380
where it suddenly flipped.

163
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,236
A young and growing population

164
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,356
combined with significant economic growth

165
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,796
made its mark with a big bang

166
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,300
and no one in the markets saw it coming.

167
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,076
This flip was everything to global agricultural markets.

168
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,916
Luckily now, South America

169
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,156
was starting to boom at the same time as China's rise,

170
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,180
and so therefore, supply and demand were still somewhat balanced.

171
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,540
So the question becomes,

172
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,060
where do we go from here?

173
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,156
Oddly enough,

174
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,380
it's not a new story,

175
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,996
except this time it's not just a story of China.

176
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,396
It's a continuation of China,

177
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,516
an amplification of Africa

178
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,500
and a paradigm shift in India.

179
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,940
By 2023,

180
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,876
Africa's population is forecasted to overtake that of India's and China's.

181
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,556
By 2023, these three regions combined

182
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,740
will make up over half the world's population.

183
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,236
This crossover point starts to present really interesting challenges

184
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,996
for global food security.

185
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,420
And a few years later, we're hit hard with that reality.

186
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,300
What does the world look like in 10 years?

187
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,836
So far, as I mentioned, India has been food self-sufficient.

188
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,260
Most forecasters predict that this will continue.

189
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,220
We disagree.

190
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,116
India will soon become a net importer of calories.

191
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,396
This will be driven both by the fact

192
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,916
that demand is growing from a population growth standpoint

193
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,196
plus economic growth.

194
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,476
It will be driven by both.

195
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,196
And even if you have optimistic assumptions

196
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,116
around production growth,

197
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,260
it will make that slight flip.

198
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,700
That slight flip can have huge implications.

199
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,156
Next, Africa will continue to be a net importer of calories,

200
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
again driven by population growth and economic growth.

201
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,836
This is again assuming optimistic production growth assumptions.

202
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,276
Then China,

203
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,876
where population is flattening out,

204
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,876
calorie consumption will explode

205
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,916
because the types of calories consumed

206
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,460
are also starting to be higher-calorie-content foods.

207
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,156
And so therefore,

208
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,036
these three regions combined

209
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,356
start to present a really interesting challenge for the world.

210
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,476
Until now, countries with calorie deficits

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,076
have been able to meet these deficits

212
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,940
by importing from surplus regions.

213
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,356
By surplus regions, I'm talking about

214
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,516
North America, South America and Europe.

215
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,956
This line chart over here shows you

216
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,276
the growth and the projected growth over the next decade of production

217
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,596
from North America, South America and Europe.

218
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,036
What it doesn't show you

219
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,500
is that most of this growth is actually going to come from South America.

220
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,876
And most of this growth

221
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,300
is going to come at the huge cost of deforestation.

222
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,836
And so when you look at the combined demand increase

223
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,180
coming from India, China and the African continent,

224
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,836
and look at it versus the combined increase in production

225
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,636
coming from India, China, the African continent,

226
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,020
North America, South America and Europe,

227
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,516
you are left with a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,

228
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,276
one we can't produce.

229
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,236
And this, by the way, is actually assuming we take all the extra calories

230
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,641
produced in North America, South America and Europe

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,940
and export them solely to India, China and Africa.

232
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,500
What I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world.

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,180
We can do something to change that.

234
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,516
We can change consumption patterns,

235
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,796
we can reduce food waste,

236
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,036
or we can make a bold commitment

237
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,380
to increasing yields exponentially.

238
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,676
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing

239
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,196
changing consumption patterns or reducing food waste,

240
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,276
because those conversations have been going on for some time now.

241
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,516
Nothing has happened.

242
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,996
Nothing has happened because those arguments

243
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,956
ask the surplus regions to change their behavior

244
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,420
on behalf of deficit regions.

245
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,276
Waiting for others to change their behavior

246
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,796
on your behalf, for your survival,

247
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,316
is a terrible idea.

248
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,940
It's unproductive.

249
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,100
So I'd like to suggest an alternative that comes from the red regions.

250
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,156
China, India, Africa.

251
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,476
China is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has

252
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,036
available for agriculture,

253
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,836
and it has massive water resource availability issues.

254
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,500
So the answer really lies in India and in Africa.

255
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,596
India has some upside in terms of potential yield increases.

256
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,196
Now this is the gap between its current yield

257
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,340
and the theoretical maximum yield it can achieve.

258
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,756
It has some unfarmed arable land remaining, but not much,

259
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,060
India is quite land-constrained.

260
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,716
Now, the African continent, on the other hand,

261
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,036
has vast amounts of arable land remaining

262
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,740
and significant upside potential in yields.

263
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,996
Somewhat simplified picture here,

264
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,036
but if you look at sub-Saharan African yields in corn today,

265
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,540
they are where North American yields were in 1940.

266
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,156
We don't have 70-plus years to figure this out,

267
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,716
so it means we need to try something new

268
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,900
and we need to try something different.

269
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,380
The solution starts with reforms.

270
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,676
We need to reform and commercialize

271
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,236
the agricultural industries in Africa

272
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,460
and in India.

273
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,276
Now, by commercialization --

274
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,436
commercialization is not about commercial farming alone.

275
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,036
Commercialization is about leveraging data

276
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,356
to craft better policies,

277
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,996
to improve infrastructure,

278
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,876
to lower the transportation costs

279
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,156
and to completely reform banking and insurance industries.

280
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,276
Commercialization is about taking agriculture

281
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,396
from too risky an endeavor to one where fortunes can be made.

282
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,676
Commercialization is not about just farmers.

283
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,980
Commercialization is about the entire agricultural system.

284
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,716
But commercialization also means confronting the fact

285
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,156
that we can no longer place the burden of growth

286
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,300
on small-scale farmers alone,

287
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,676
and accepting that commercial farms and the introduction of commercial farms

288
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,396
could provide certain economies of scale

289
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,660
that even small-scale farmers can leverage.

290
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,836
It is not about small-scale farming or commercial agriculture,

291
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,716
or big agriculture.

292
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,996
We can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success

293
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,796
of small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture.

294
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,836
This is because, for the first time ever,

295
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,596
the most critical tool for success in the industry --

296
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,116
data and knowledge --

297
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,380
is becoming cheaper by the day.

298
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,956
And very soon, it won't matter how much money you have

299
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,436
or how big you are

300
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,756
to make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success

301
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,260
in reaching your intended goal.

302
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Companies like Gro are working really hard to make this a reality.

303
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,996
So if we can commit to this new, bold initiative,

304
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,036
to this new, bold change,

305
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,476
not only can we solve the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,

306
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,100
but we can actually set the world on a whole new path.

307
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,876
India can remain food self-sufficient

308
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,660
and Africa can emerge as the world's next dark blue region.

309
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,276
The new question is,

310
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,436
how do we produce 214 trillion calories

311
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,620
to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?

312
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,060
We have the solution.

313
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,580
We just need to act on it.

314
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,556
Thank you.

315
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,939
(Applause)
