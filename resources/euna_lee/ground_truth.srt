1
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:16,930
I recently read about what the young generation of workers want

2
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,805
in Harvard Business Review.

3
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:23,841
One thing that stuck out to me was: don't just talk about impact,

4
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,526
but make an impact.

5
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:28,547
I'm a little bit older than you,

6
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,228
maybe much older than you,

7
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:35,785
but this is exactly the same goal that I had when I was in college.

8
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,994
I wanted to make my own impact for those who live under injustice;

9
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,399
it's the reason that I became a documentary journalist,

10
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:46,986
the reason I became

11
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:50,961
a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,677
It was March 17, 2009.

13
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:58,242
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,

14
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,820
but it was the day that turned my life upside down.

15
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:07,947
My team and I were making a documentary about North Korean refugees

16
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:11,441
living below human life in China.

17
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:15,082
We were at the border.

18
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,964
It was our last day of filming.

19
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,044
There was no wire fence

20
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,338
or bars

21
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:25,658
or sign to show that it is the border,

22
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:29,433
but this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use

23
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,919
as an escape route.

24
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,489
It was still winter,

25
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:37,006
and the river was frozen.

26
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:41,181
When we were in the middle of the frozen river,

27
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:44,117
we were filming about the condition of the cold weather

28
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,339
and the environment

29
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,089
that North Koreans had to deal with

30
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:49,940
when they seek their freedom.

31
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,114
And suddenly, one of my team members shouted,

32
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:55,291
"Soldiers!"

33
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,454
So I looked back,

34
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,126
and there were two small soldiers in green uniforms with rifles,

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,542
chasing after us.

36
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:07,746
We all ran as fast as we could.

37
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,582
I prayed that, please don't let them shoot my head.

38
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:14,044
And I was thinking that,

39
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,802
if my feet are on Chinese soil,

40
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,179
I'll be safe.

41
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,396
And I made it to Chinese soil.

42
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:25,522
Then I saw my colleague Laura Ling fall on her knees.

43
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,867
I didn't know what to do at that short moment,

44
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,518
but I knew that I could not leave her alone there

45
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:34,533
when she said, "Euna, I can't feel my legs."

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,483
In a flash, we were surrounded by these two Korean soldiers.

47
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,850
They were not much bigger than us,

48
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:46,573
but they were determined to take us to their army base.

49
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,800
I begged and yelled for any kind of help,

50
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:53,976
hoping that someone would show up from China.

51
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,118
Here I was, being stubborn

52
00:02:57,784 --> 00:03:00,296
towards a trained soldier with a gun.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,977
I looked at his eyes.

54
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,886
He was just a boy.

55
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,369
At that moment, he raised his rifle to hit me,

56
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,535
but I saw that he was hesitating.

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,334
His eyes were shaking,

58
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:17,496
and his rifle was still up in the air.

59
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,299
So I shouted at him,

60
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,629
"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."

61
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,551
And I got up.

62
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,903
When we arrived at their army base,

63
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:33,711
my head was spinning with these worst-case scenarios,

64
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,700
and my colleague's statement wasn't helping.

65
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,846
She said, "We are the enemy."

66
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:42,457
She was right: we were the enemy.

67
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,795
And I was supposed to be frightened, too.

68
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,530
But I kept having these odd experiences.

69
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:53,497
This time, an officer brought me his coat

70
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:54,932
to keep me warm,

71
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,947
because I lost my coat on the frozen river

72
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,178
while battling with one of these soldiers.

73
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:06,599
I will tell you what I mean by these odd experiences.

74
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,916
I grew up in South Korea.

75
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:13,339
To us, North Korea was always the enemy,

76
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:14,801
even before I was born.

77
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:20,837
South and North have been under armistice for 63 years,

78
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,978
since the end of the Korean War.

79
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:27,498
And growing up in the South in the '80s and '90s,

80
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:30,999
we were taught propaganda about North Korea.

81
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,649
And we heard so many graphic stories,

82
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:39,388
such as, a little young boy being brutally killed

83
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,888
by North Korean spies just because he said,

84
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,285
"I don't like communists."

85
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:49,273
Or, I watched this cartoon series

86
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:54,052
about a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig,

87
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:58,041
which represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time.

88
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:03,819
And the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over

89
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,231
instilled one word in a young mind:

90
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:09,448
"enemy."

91
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,373
And I think at some point, I dehumanized them,

92
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,219
and the people of North Korea became equated

93
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,655
with the North Korean government.

94
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,764
Now, back to my detention.

95
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:27,941
It was the second day

96
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,341
of being in a cell.

97
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:33,255
I had not slept since I was out at the border.

98
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,530
This young guard came to my cell

99
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:41,070
and offered me this small boiled egg

100
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:44,649
and said, "This will give you strength to keep going."

101
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:48,227
Do you know what it is like,

102
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,718
receiving a small kindness in the enemy's hand?

103
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,879
Whenever they were kind to me, I thought the worst case

104
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:58,990
was waiting for me after the kindness.

105
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,931
One officer noticed my nervousness.

106
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:08,390
He said, "Did you think we were all these red pigs?"

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,616
referring to the cartoon that I just showed you.

108
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,457
Every day was like a psychological battle.

109
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,572
The interrogator had me sit at a table

110
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,096
six days a week

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,210
and had me writing down about my journey, my work,

112
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:31,949
over and over until I wrote down the confession that they wanted to hear.

113
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,275
After about three months of detention,

114
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:41,161
the North Korean court sentenced me

115
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,669
to 12 years in a labor camp.

116
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,455
So I was just sitting in my room to be transferred.

117
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,604
At that time, I really had nothing else to do,

118
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:53,512
so I paid attention to these two female guards

119
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,882
and listened to what they were talking about.

120
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,812
Guard A was older,

121
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,293
and she studied English.

122
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:05,284
She seemed like she came from an affluent family.

123
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,736
She often showed up with these colorful dresses,

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,303
and then loved to show off.

125
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,381
And Guard B was the younger one,

126
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:15,215
and she was a really good singer.

127
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:20,991
She loved to sing Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" --

128
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:22,481
sometimes too much.

129
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:26,337
She knew just how to torture me without knowing.

130
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,005
(Laughter)

131
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:34,698
And this girl spent a lot of time in the morning to put on makeup,

132
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,057
like you can see in any young girl's life.

133
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:43,161
And they loved to watch this Chinese drama,

134
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,971
a better quality production.

135
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:48,022
I remember Guard B said,

136
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:52,769
"I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this."

137
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,675
She got scolded

138
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,895
for degrading her own country's produced TV shows.

139
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,920
Guard B had more of a free mind than Guard A,

140
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:09,556
and she often got scolded by Guard A whenever she expressed herself.

141
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,533
One day, they invited all these female colleagues --

142
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,458
I don't know where they came from --

143
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:18,024
to where I was held,

144
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,616
and they invited me

145
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,414
to their guard room

146
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,023
and asked

147
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:26,626
if one-night stands really happen in the US.

148
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,836
(Laughter)

149
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,915
This is the country where young couples are not even allowed

150
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:36,619
to hold hands in public.

151
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:39,571
I had no idea where they had gotten this information,

152
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:43,172
but they were shy and giggly even before I said anything.

153
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:47,807
I think we all forgot that I was their prisoner,

154
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:52,105
and it was like going back to my high school classroom again.

155
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,860
And I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon,

156
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:03,920
but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US.

157
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:09,403
I started to understand where these people's anger was coming from.

158
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:13,218
If these girls grew up learning that we are enemies,

159
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,463
it was just natural that they would hate us

160
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:18,316
just as I feared them.

161
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:23,705
But at that moment, we were all just girls

162
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,522
who shared the same interests,

163
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:30,161
beyond our ideologies that separated us.

164
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:36,296
I shared these stories with my boss at Current TV at the time

165
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,730
after I came home.

166
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:40,232
His first reaction was,

167
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:43,148
"Euna, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?"

168
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:48,131
Yes, and I clearly remember

169
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,633
the feeling of fear

170
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,164
and being threatened,

171
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:57,362
and tension rising up between me and the interrogator

172
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,355
when we talked about politics.

173
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,391
There definitely was a wall that we couldn't climb over.

174
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:08,216
But we were able to see each other as human beings

175
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,641
when we talked about family,

176
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:12,242
everyday life,

177
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:15,177
the importance of the future for our children.

178
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:21,286
It was about a month before I came home.

179
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,642
I got really sick.

180
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:27,543
Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,

181
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,396
because she was leaving the detention center.

182
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:35,815
She made sure that no one watched us,

183
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,423
no one heard us,

184
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,002
and quietly said,

185
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,856
"I hope you get better

186
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,781
and go back to your family soon."

187
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,763
It is these people --

188
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,304
the officer who brought me his coat,

189
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:54,844
the guard who offered me a boiled egg,

190
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:59,598
these female guards who asked me about dating life in the US --

191
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:04,195
they are the ones that I remember of North Korea:

192
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,642
humans just like us.

193
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,009
North Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries,

194
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,618
but I believe that we were representing

195
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,147
the human race.

196
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,806
Now I'm back home and back to my life.

197
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:28,733
The memory of these people has blurred as time has passed.

198
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,056
And I'm in this place

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,377
where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US.

200
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,267
I realized how easy it is

201
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:41,005
to see them as an enemy again.

202
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:48,110
But I have to keep reminding myself that when I was over there,

203
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,389
I was able to see humanity

204
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,565
over hatred

205
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,180
in my enemy's eyes.

206
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,996
Thank you.

207
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,154
(Applause)
