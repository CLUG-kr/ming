1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,455
Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.

2
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:18,637
Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers,

3
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,208
it probably powers much of the Internet.

4
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,995
And I think that there are, like,

5
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,364
a billion and a half active Android devices out there.

6
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,989
Your software is in every single one of them.

7
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:31,778
It's kind of amazing.

8
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:36,837
You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.

9
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:40,167
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.

10
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,391
I mean, this is --

11
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,665
this is the Linux world headquarters.

12
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,679
(Laughter)

13
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:49,709
(Applause)

14
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,019
Linus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.

15
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,719
And I have to say,

16
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:57,563
the most interesting part in this picture,

17
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:59,290
that people mostly react to,

18
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:00,757
is the walking desk.

19
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,480
It is the most interesting part in my office

20
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,464
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

21
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:07,780
And I think the two things are related.

22
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,351
The way I work is ...

23
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:17,414
I want to not have external stimulation.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,257
You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.

25
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,745
I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.

26
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:28,816
(Laughter)

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,625
It's like a calming color,

28
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:33,766
it's not something that really stimulates you.

29
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:39,309
What you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen,

30
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,714
but the main thing I worry about in my computer is --

31
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:46,073
it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that --

32
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:48,929
it really has to be completely silent.

33
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,806
I know people who work for Google

34
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,037
and they have their own small data center at home,

35
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:56,213
and I don't do that.

36
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:59,942
My office is the most boring office you'll ever see.

37
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:03,480
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

38
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,993
If the cat comes up,

39
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:07,854
it sits in my lap.

40
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,068
And I want to hear the cat purring,

41
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,266
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

42
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,599
CA: So this is astonishing,

43
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,301
because working this way,

44
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:20,313
you're able to run this vast technology empire --

45
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:21,558
it is an empire --

46
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:25,282
so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.

47
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:29,482
Tell us how you got to understand open source

48
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:31,758
and how it lead to the development of Linux.

49
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,871
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

50
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:38,462
Really -- I work alone in my house,

51
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:39,876
often in my bathrobe.

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,461
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

53
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:43,771
so I have clothes on.

54
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,032
(Laughter)

55
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,128
And that's how I've always worked.

56
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:49,160
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

57
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:52,833
I did not start Linux as a collaborative project.

58
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:57,735
I started it as one in a series of many projects

59
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,716
I had done at the time for myself,

60
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,642
partly because I needed the end result,

61
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,968
but even more because I just enjoyed programming.

62
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:10,366
So it was about the end of the journey,

63
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,736
which, 25 years later, we still have not reached.

64
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,477
But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own

65
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,330
and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.

66
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,820
And what happened is ...

67
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:29,040
the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.

68
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:34,489
Really, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!"

69
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:37,068
And trust me -- it was not that great back then.

70
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:39,822
I made it publicly available,

71
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,952
and it wasn't even open source at that point.

72
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:47,145
At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention

73
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:52,283
behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today

74
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,458
to improve it.

75
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,633
It was more like,

76
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,594
"Look, I've been working on this for half a year,

77
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,018
I'd love to have comments."

78
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,537
And other people approached me.

79
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,689
At the University of Helsinki,

80
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:08,428
I had a friend who was one of the open source --

81
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:12,108
it was called mainly "free software" back then --

82
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:16,406
and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey,

83
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,787
you can use these open-source licenses that had been around.

84
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,975
And I thought about it for a while.

85
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,490
I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.

86
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:33,988
I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have,

87
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:38,972
is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?

88
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:42,679
And I decided, "What the hell?"

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,710
And --

90
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,029
CA: And then at some point,

91
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,513
someone contributed some code that you thought,

92
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:51,708
"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.

93
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,383
This could actually improve this."

94
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,932
LT: It didn't even start by people contributing code,

95
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,935
it was more that people started contributing ideas.

96
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,814
And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project --

97
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,386
and I'm sure it's true of other things, too,

98
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,247
but it's definitely true in code --

99
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:10,770
is that somebody else takes an interest in your code,

100
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:13,316
looks at it enough to actually give you feedback

101
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,229
and give you ideas.

102
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,954
That was a huge thing for me.

103
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,170
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

104
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,431
but I had already programmed for half my life, basically.

105
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:28,164
And every project before that had been completely personal

106
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:31,295
and it was a revelation when people just started commenting,

107
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,620
started giving feedback on your code.

108
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:38,416
And even before they started giving code back,

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,181
that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said,

110
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,078
"I love other people!"

111
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,259
Don't get me wrong --

112
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,907
I'm actually not a people person.

113
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:49,296
(Laughter)

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,872
I don't really love other people --

115
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:52,916
(Laughter)

116
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,566
But I love computers,

117
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,805
I love interacting with other people on email,

118
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,161
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

119
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:06,686
But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.

120
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,363
And it made it so much more.

121
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,927
CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built

122
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,158
and it suddenly started taking off,

123
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:17,472
and you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge,

124
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:20,408
not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on,

125
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:24,752
but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?

126
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,800
LT: Not really.

127
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:30,396
I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge,

128
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,554
it was when it was becoming little.

129
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:37,046
The big point for me was not being alone

130
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,787
and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved --

131
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,290
that was a big point.

132
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,353
Then everything else was very gradual.

133
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:49,636
Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal -- to me.

134
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,493
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

135
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:52,518
(Laughter)

136
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,260
If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal --

137
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,435
don't get me wrong.

138
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,586
But if you're interested in the technology

139
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,465
and you're interested in the project,

140
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,370
the big part was getting the community.

141
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:04,018
Then the community grew gradually.

142
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:07,390
And there's actually not a single point where I went like,

143
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,162
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

144
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:13,510
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

145
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,510
CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you

146
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:19,408
with massively changing their work.

147
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,055
And it's not just Linux,

148
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,525
it's this thing called Git,

149
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:26,561
which is this management system for software development.

150
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:29,370
Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.

151
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,090
LT: So one of the issues we had,

152
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:35,166
and this took a while to start to appear,

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,345
is when you ...

154
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:42,860
When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project

155
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:45,272
to having 10,000 people, which --

156
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:48,762
I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel,

157
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,960
we have 1,000 people involved in every single release

158
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:55,570
and that's every two months, roughly two or three months.

159
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,577
Some of those people don't do a lot.

160
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:01,184
There's a lot of people who make small, small changes.

161
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,454
But to maintain this,

162
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:06,367
the scale changes how you have to maintain it.

163
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:08,789
And we went through a lot of pain.

164
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:17,062
And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.

165
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:20,378
CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used,

166
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:24,299
and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it

167
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:27,386
and tried something else that was radical and interesting

168
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,066
and everybody else hated.

169
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,198
CA: (Laughs)

170
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,310
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

171
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,151
where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate,

172
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:42,216
but in many ways, I was the kind of break point,

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,764
where I could not scale to the point

174
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:47,588
where I could work with thousands of people.

175
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:50,064
So Git is my second big project,

176
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:54,626
which was only created for me to maintain my first big project.

177
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,500
And this is literally how I work.

178
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:00,029
I don't code for --

179
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,775
well, I do code for fun --

180
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,180
but I want to code for something meaningful

181
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:08,251
so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed

182
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,651
and --

183
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:13,108
CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose

184
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,468
almost as an unintended consequence

185
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:18,163
of your desire not to have to work with too many people.

186
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:19,338
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

187
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,442
(Laughter)

188
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,116
CA: That's amazing. LT: Yeah.

189
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,632
(Applause)

190
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,047
And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology

191
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,388
not just once but twice,

192
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,995
and we have to try and understand why it is.

193
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,703
You've given us some clues, but ...

194
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:37,368
Here's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.

195
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:41,512
You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11,

196
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:42,901
half your life.

197
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:46,741
Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd,

198
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,250
were you the star at school who could do everything?

199
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:50,806
What were you like as a kid?

200
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,443
LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.

201
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:55,736
I mean, I was ...

202
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,912
I was not a people person back then.

203
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,516
That's my younger brother.

204
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,327
I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube

205
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:05,876
than my younger brother.

206
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,987
(Laughter)

207
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:10,131
My younger sister, who's not in the picture,

208
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:12,569
when we had family meetings --

209
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:16,385
and it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins --

210
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,273
she would prep me beforehand.

211
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,863
Like, before I stepped into the room she would say,

212
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,430
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

213
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,074
Because I was not --

214
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,313
I was a geek.

215
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,503
I was into computers,

216
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,686
I was into math,

217
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,861
I was into physics.

218
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:34,036
I was good at that.

219
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,846
I don't think I was particularly exceptional.

220
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,765
Apparently, my sister said

221
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:46,640
that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.

222
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,995
CA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.

223
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,193
You would not let go.

224
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,082
So that's not about being a geek and being smart,

225
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:57,211
that's about being ... stubborn?

226
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:58,762
LT: That's about being stubborn.

227
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,174
That's about, like,

228
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,113
just starting something

229
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:08,587
and not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else --

230
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:09,798
Look: shiny!"

231
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:14,155
And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.

232
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,540
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

233
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:22,676
And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley,

234
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,414
for the whole time.

235
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:25,976
That is unheard of.

236
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,791
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

237
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:32,394
The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs

238
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:35,045
to kind of mix up the pot.

239
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,949
And that's not the kind of person I am.

240
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:39,544
CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself,

241
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:43,864
that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.

242
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:45,919
Talk about that a bit.

243
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:51,487
Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?

244
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,676
How would you describe what happened?

245
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,295
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

246
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,204
Going back to the "I'm not a people person," --

247
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:02,016
sometimes I'm also ...

248
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,453
shall we say,

249
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,897
"myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings,

250
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:14,765
and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.

251
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,557
And I'm not proud of that.

252
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,695
(Applause)

253
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,517
But, at the same time, it's --

254
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:25,874
I get people who tell me that I should be nice.

255
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:32,284
And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice,

256
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,562
maybe you should be more aggressive,

257
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:38,128
they see that as me being not nice.

258
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:40,262
(Laughter)

259
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,454
What I'm trying to say is we are different.

260
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,288
I'm not a people person;

261
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:46,418
it's not something I'm particularly proud of,

262
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:47,982
but it's part of me.

263
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,711
And one of the things I really like about open source

264
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:56,527
is it really allows different people to work together.

265
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,275
We don't have to like each other --

266
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,502
and sometimes we really don't like each other.

267
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:04,013
Really -- I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.

268
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:07,029
But you can, actually, you can find things that --

269
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:10,374
you don't even agree to disagree,

270
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,444
it's just that you're interested in really different things.

271
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,371
And coming back to the point where I said earlier

272
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,688
that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work,

273
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:23,311
it turned out, and very quickly turned out,

274
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,301
that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.

275
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:30,031
And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing,

276
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,112
and they had completely different goals.

277
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:37,459
And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.

278
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,745
But because it was open source they could do it,

279
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,121
and it actually works really beautifully together.

280
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,169
And I actually think it works the same way.

281
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:47,398
You need to have the people-people, the communicators,

282
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:48,849
the warm and friendly people

283
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:50,595
who like --

284
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,061
(Laughter)

285
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:55,135
really want to hug you and get you into the community.

286
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,730
But that's not everybody.

287
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,186
And that's not me.

288
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,667
I care about the technology.

289
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:01,572
There are people who care about the UI.

290
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:04,666
I can't do UI to save my life.

291
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,711
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

292
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:11,135
and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI,

293
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,322
I'd die there.

294
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:13,497
(Laughter)

295
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,660
So there's different kinds of people,

296
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:18,549
and I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.

297
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:20,239
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

298
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:22,748
you talked about some other trait that you have,

299
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,363
which I found really interesting.

300
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:25,770
It's this idea called taste.

301
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:27,796
And I've just got a couple of images here.

302
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:32,177
I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code,

303
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:35,192
and this one is better taste,

304
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,279
which one can immediately see.

305
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,276
What is the difference between these two?

306
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,641
LT: So this is --

307
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:44,342
How many people here actually have coded?

308
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,011
CA: Oh my goodness.

309
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,190
LT: So I guarantee you,

310
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,759
everybody who raised their hand,

311
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:52,404
they have done what's called a singly-linked list.

312
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,437
And it's taught --

313
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,526
This, the first not very good taste approach,

314
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,617
is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.

315
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:04,685
And you don't have to understand the code.

316
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,765
The most interesting part to me

317
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,978
is the last if statement.

318
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:13,013
Because what happens in a singly-linked list --

319
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,687
this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list --

320
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:20,553
and there's a difference between if it's the first entry

321
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,576
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

322
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,205
Because if it's the first entry,

323
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:27,245
you have to change the pointer to the first entry.

324
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,467
If it's in the middle,

325
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,912
you have to change the pointer of a previous entry.

326
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:32,960
So they're two completely different cases.

327
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,136
CA: And that's better.

328
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,341
LT: And this is better.

329
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,083
It does not have the if statement.

330
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,670
And it doesn't really matter --

331
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:43,895
I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement,

332
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,261
but I want you to understand

333
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,910
that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way

334
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:51,288
and rewrite it so that a special case goes away

335
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,189
and becomes the normal case.

336
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,752
And that's good code.

337
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:56,698
But this is simple code.

338
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,071
This is CS 101.

339
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,951
This is not important -- although, details are important.

340
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,696
To me, the sign of people I really want to work with

341
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,393
is that they have good taste, which is how ...

342
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,712
I sent you this stupid example

343
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,080
that is not relevant because it's too small.

344
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:15,705
Good taste is much bigger than this.

345
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:19,750
Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns

346
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:24,232
and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.

347
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,913
CA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.

348
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,023
You have taste,

349
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,214
in a way that's meaningful to software people.

350
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,389
You're --

351
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,229
(Laughter)

352
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,814
LT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.

353
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,704
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

354
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:44,425
and you're hellish stubborn.

355
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,028
But there must be something else.

356
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,675
I mean, you've changed the future.

357
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:51,662
You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.

358
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:52,947
You're a visionary, right?

359
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,562
LT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED

360
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,746
for the last two days,

361
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,365
because there's a lot of vision going on, right?

362
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,086
And I am not a visionary.

363
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,339
I do not have a five-year plan.

364
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:05,721
I'm an engineer.

365
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,005
And I think it's really --

366
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:09,348
I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people

367
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:12,123
who are walking around and just staring at the clouds

368
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,998
and looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there."

369
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:16,474
But I'm looking at the ground,

370
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:19,353
and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me

371
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:20,737
before I fall in.

372
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,380
This is the kind of person I am.

373
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,515
(Cheers)

374
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,851
(Applause)

375
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,486
CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.

376
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,613
Who are they and how do you relate to them?

377
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,661
LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology,

378
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,692
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

379
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:42,657
where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.

380
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,463
And people love Tesla.

381
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:48,474
I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.

382
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,648
(Laughter)

383
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,797
The other person there is Edison,

384
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:57,328
who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian

385
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,273
and is --

386
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:02,019
I mean, his most famous quote is,

387
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:06,757
"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."

388
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,667
And I'm in the Edison camp,

389
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:10,875
even if people don't always like him.

390
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,918
Because if you actually compare the two,

391
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:18,475
Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days,

392
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,498
but who actually changed the world?

393
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:25,055
Edison may not have been a nice person,

394
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,211
he did a lot of things --

395
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,664
he was maybe not so intellectual,

396
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,915
not so visionary.

397
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:36,600
But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.

398
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,927
CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams --

399
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,298
big, bold, audacious dreams.

400
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:43,124
You're really the antidote to that.

401
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:45,257
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

402
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,432
CA: That's good.

403
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,536
(Laughter)

404
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,165
We embrace you, we embrace you.

405
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,615
Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably,

406
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,845
like, billions of dollars out of your software.

407
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,020
Does that piss you off?

408
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,195
LT: No.

409
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,853
No, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.

410
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:02,887
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

411
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,207
I'm really doing fine.

412
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:06,346
But the other reason is --

413
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,697
I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing,

414
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,947
Linux would never have been what it is.

415
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:19,067
And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking,

416
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,242
but at the same time, this is an experience.

417
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,546
Trust me.

418
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:28,201
So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man

419
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:30,754
and thinking I did the right choices.

420
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,690
CA: Is the open source idea --

421
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,350
this is, I think we'll end here --

422
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:38,428
is the open source idea fully realized now in the world,

423
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:41,470
or is there more that it could go,

424
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,509
are there more things that it could do?

425
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,792
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

426
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:51,302
I think one reason open source works so well in code

427
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,735
is that at the end of the day,

428
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,005
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

429
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,186
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

430
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,156
this is done correctly and this is not done well.

431
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,558
Code either works or it doesn't,

432
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:12,190
which means that there's less room for arguments.

433
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:15,845
And we have arguments despite this, right?

434
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,784
In many other areas --

435
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:21,549
I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that --

436
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:24,522
and it's really hard sometimes to say

437
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:28,303
that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas

438
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:33,766
just because the black and white turns into not just gray,

439
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,393
but different colors.

440
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,525
So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.

441
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:42,183
Science was there first.

442
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,874
But then science ended up being pretty closed,

443
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:48,522
with very expensive journals and some of that going on.

444
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:52,382
And open source is making a comeback in science,

445
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:56,553
with things like arXiv and open journals.

446
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:01,035
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

447
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,513
So there are other examples,

448
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,170
I'm sure there are more to come.

449
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,047
CA: But you're not a visionary,

450
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,024
and so it's not up to you to name them.

451
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,207
LT: No.

452
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,279
(Laughter)

453
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,267
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

454
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,554
CA: Exactly.

455
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,736
Linus Torvalds,

456
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,005
thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet,

457
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:19,894
thank you for all those Android phones.

458
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:23,115
Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.

459
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,291
LT: Thank you.

460
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:28,755
(Applause)
