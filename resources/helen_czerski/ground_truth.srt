1
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,305
As you heard, I'm a physicist.

2
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:19,314
And I think the way we talk about physics needs a little modification.

3
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:22,699
I am from just down the road here; I don't live here anymore.

4
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:27,230
But coming from round here means that I have a northern nana,

5
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:28,421
my mum's mom.

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,472
And Nana is very bright; she hasn't had much formal education,

7
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:33,664
but she's sharp.

8
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:37,766
And when I was a second-year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge,

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,633
I remember spending an afternoon at Nana's house in Urmston

10
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:44,039
studying quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,354
And I had these folders open in front of me

12
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:49,276
with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,004
And Nana came along, and she looked at this folder,

14
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:55,619
and she said, "What's that?"

15
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,999
I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana."

16
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:03,829
And I tried to explain something about what was on the page.

17
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:07,842
It was to do with the nucleus and Einstein A and B coefficients.

18
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,656
And Nana looked very impressed.

19
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:11,723
And then she said, "Oh.

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,873
What can you do when you know that?"

21
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,897
(Laughter)

22
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:20,544
"Don't know, ma'am."

23
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:21,632
(Laughter)

24
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,656
I think I said something about computers,

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,758
because it was all I could think of at the time.

26
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:30,426
But you can broaden that question out, because it's a very good question --

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,352
"What can you do when you know that?" when "that" is physics?

28
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:36,844
And I've come to realize that when we talk about physics in society

29
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,270
and our sort of image of it,

30
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:41,446
we don't include the things that we can do when we know that.

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,183
Our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift.

32
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,111
Not only does it need a bit of a shift,

33
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:51,691
but sharing this different perspective matters for our society,

34
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,923
and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist and I'm biased

35
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,714
and I think we're the most important people in the world.

36
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:58,889
Honest.

37
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:02,555
So, the image of physics -- we've got an image problem, let's be honest --

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,393
it hasn't moved on much from this.

39
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:08,549
This is a very famous photograph that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.

40
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:12,818
This is when the great minds of physics were grappling

41
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,088
with the nature of determinism

42
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:17,192
and what it means only to have a probability

43
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,927
that a particle might be somewhere,

44
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,533
and whether any of it was real.

45
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,024
And it was all very difficult.

46
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:25,011
And you'll notice they're all very stern-looking men in suits.

47
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:27,945
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying, "Marie Antoinette,"

48
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,933
which would be a turn-up for the books --

49
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,553
Marie Curie, third from the left on the bottom there,

50
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,292
she was allowed in, but had to dress like everybody else.

51
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,341
(Laughter)

52
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:40,255
So, this is what physics is like -- there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,

53
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:42,452
these are to do with waves and particles.

54
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,656
That is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding,

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,968
which makes it look worth watching, to be honest.

56
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,384
I'm glad I didn't have to write the risk assessment

57
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,940
for whatever was going on there.

58
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,317
The point is: this is the image of physics, right?

59
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,540
It's weird and difficult,

60
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,688
done by slightly strange people dressed in a slightly strange way.

61
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,713
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else

62
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,547
and fundamentally, why should I care?

63
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,339
And the problem with that is that I'm a physicist,

64
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,836
and I study this.

65
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,146
This -- this is my job, right?

66
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,870
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.

67
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,182
The atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive,

68
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:19,307
and the thin layer that joins them together

69
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,493
is really important,

70
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,734
because that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other.

71
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:27,472
You can see that the sea surface -- that was me who took this video --

72
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:30,631
the average height of those waves by the way, was 10 meters.

73
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:33,150
So this is definitely physics happening here --

74
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,722
there's lots of things -- this is definitely physics.

75
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:39,296
And yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics,

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,146
and that bothers me.

77
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,498
So what is included in our cultural perception of physics?

78
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,332
Because I'm a physicist, there has to be a graph, right?

79
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,512
That's allowed.

80
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:52,797
We've got time along the bottom here, from very fast things there,

81
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:56,262
to things that take a long time over here.

82
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,781
Small things at the bottom, big things up there.

83
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,830
So, our current cultural image of physics looks like this.

84
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:04,375
There's quantum mechanics down in that corner,

85
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,399
it's very small, it's very weird,

86
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,424
it happens very quickly,

87
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,729
and it's a long way down in the general ...

88
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,587
on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life.

89
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,943
And then there's cosmology, which is up there;

90
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,278
very large, very far away,

91
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,302
also very weird.

92
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,326
And if you go to some places

93
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,414
like black holes in the beginning of the universe,

94
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:28,440
we know that these are frontiers in physics, right?

95
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:31,219
There's lots of work being done to discover new physics

96
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:32,669
in these places.

97
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,654
But the thing is, you will notice there's a very large gap in the middle.

98
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:38,836
And in that gap, there are many things.

99
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,503
There are planets and toasts and volcanoes and clouds

100
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,664
and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins

101
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:46,947
and all sorts of things that make up our everyday life.

102
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:50,084
And these are also run by physics, you'd be surprised --

103
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:53,407
there is physics in the middle, it's just that nobody talks about it.

104
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:57,402
And the thing about all of these is that they all run

105
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:00,957
on a relatively small number of physical laws,

106
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,859
things like Newton's laws of motion,

107
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,046
thermodynamics,

108
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,785
some rotational dynamics.

109
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,337
The physics in the middle applies over a huge range,

110
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,982
from very, very small things to very, very big things.

111
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,380
You have to try very hard to get outside of this.

112
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:18,205
And there is also a frontier in research physics here,

113
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,032
it's just that nobody talks about it.

114
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,733
This is the world of the complex.

115
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,004
When these laws work together, they bring about

116
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:26,858
the beautiful, messy, complex world we live in.

117
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:30,555
Fundamentally, this is the bit that really matters to me

118
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,769
on an everyday basis.

119
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,972
And this is the bit that we don't talk about.

120
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:36,330
There's plenty of physics research going on here.

121
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:38,728
But because it doesn't involve pointing at stars,

122
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,834
people for some reason think it's not that.

123
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:44,340
Now, the cool thing about this is that there are so many things

124
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,364
in this middle bit,

125
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,222
all following the same physical laws,

126
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,571
that we can see those laws at work

127
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,595
almost all the time around us.

128
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,034
I've got a little video here.

129
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:59,021
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw and one of them has been boiled.

130
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:01,045
I want you to tell me which one is which.

131
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,335
Which one's raw?

132
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,505
(Audience responds)

133
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,003
The one on the left -- yes!

134
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,867
And even though you might not have tried that, you all knew.

135
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,441
The reason for that is, you set them spinning,

136
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,648
and when you stop the cooked egg, the one that's completely solid,

137
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:16,824
you stop the entire egg.

138
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:19,411
When you stop the other one, you only stop the shell;

139
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:22,781
the liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop.

140
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:27,087
And then it pushes the shell round again, so the egg starts to rotate again.

141
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,153
This is brilliant, right?

142
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:31,442
It's a demonstration of something in physics

143
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:34,812
that we call the law of conservation of angular momentum,

144
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:37,558
which basically says that if you set something spinning

145
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:38,737
about a fixed axis,

146
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,856
that it will keep spinning unless you do something to stop it.

147
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,060
And that's really fundamental in how the universe works.

148
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,684
And it's not just eggs that it applies to,

149
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,520
although it's really useful if you're the sort of person --

150
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,487
and apparently, these people do exist --

151
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,298
who will boil eggs and then put them back in the fridge.

152
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,427
Who does that? Don't admit to it -- it's OK. We won't judge you.

153
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,520
But it's also got much broader applicabilities.

154
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,516
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.

155
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,732
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very tiny part of the sky.

156
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,877
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years,

157
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,469
not touching anything.

158
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:14,199
And yet it can point to a tiny region of sky.

159
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:18,525
For 11 and a half days, it did it in sections,

160
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:21,203
accurately enough to take amazing images like this.

161
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:22,386
So the question is:

162
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,824
How does something that is not touching anything

163
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,009
know where it is?

164
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,994
The answer is that right in the middle of it, it has something

165
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,389
that, to my great disappointment, isn't a raw egg,

166
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:32,952
but basically does the same job.

167
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,855
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,

168
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,683
and because of the law of conservation of angular momentum,

169
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,281
they keep spinning with the same axis, indefinitely.

170
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:43,394
Hubble kind of rotates around them, and so it can orient itself.

171
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:47,562
So the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use,

172
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:52,139
also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology

173
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,914
of our time.

174
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:57,545
So this is the fun bit of physics, that you learn these patterns

175
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,130
and then you can apply them again and again and again.

176
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:03,030
And it's really rewarding when you spot them in new places.

177
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,547
This is the fun of physics.

178
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:09,025
I have shown that egg video to an audience full of businesspeople once

179
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:13,699
and they were all dressed up very smartly and trying to impress their bosses.

180
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:17,502
And I was running out of time, so I showed the egg video and then said,

181
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,386
"Well, you can work it out, and ask me afterwards to check."

182
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,567
Then I left the stage.

183
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:22,744
And I had, literally,

184
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,345
middle-aged grown men tugging on my sleeve afterwards,

185
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,005
saying, "Is it this? Is it this?"

186
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,033
And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!"

187
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,077
(Laughter)

188
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,559
The joy that you get from spotting these patterns

189
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,700
doesn't go away when you're an adult.

190
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,479
And that's really important,

191
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,982
because physics is all about patterns,

192
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:41,652
and a small number of patterns give you access

193
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:45,143
to almost all of the physics in our everyday world.

194
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,738
The thing that's best about this is it involves playing with toys.

195
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,253
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed as the mundane little things

196
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:55,363
that we just give the kids to play with on a Saturday afternoon

197
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:56,552
to keep them quiet.

198
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,832
This is the stuff that actually really matters,

199
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:01,880
because this is the laws of the universe and it applies to eggs

200
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:05,183
and toast falling butter-side down and all sorts of other things,

201
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,641
just as much as it applies to modern technology

202
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:09,878
and anything else that's going on in the world.

203
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:13,616
So I think we should play with these patterns.

204
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,855
Basically, there are a small number of concepts

205
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,884
that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen,

206
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,673
that are really useful for life in the outside world.

207
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:25,254
If you want to learn about thermodynamics, a duck is a good place to start,

208
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,330
for example, why their feet don't get cold.

209
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,905
Once you've got a bit of thermodynamics with the duck,

210
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,348
you can also explain fridges.

211
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,133
Magnets that you can play with in your kitchen

212
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:38,197
get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation.

213
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:41,265
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always a good thing to play with.

214
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,568
If you're at a boring party, fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,

215
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:46,592
put them in some lemonade.

216
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,203
It's got three consequences.

217
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:50,594
First thing is, it's quite good to watch; try it.

218
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:53,133
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.

219
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,520
Thirdly, it brings the interesting people to you.

220
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:56,907
You win on all fronts.

221
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,278
And then there's spin and gas laws and viscosity.

222
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:03,794
There's these little patterns, and they're right around us everywhere.

223
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:07,379
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?

224
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:11,055
Everybody has access to the same physics; you don't need a big, posh lab.

225
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,033
When I wrote the book, I had the chapter on spin.

226
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:17,739
I had written a bit about toast falling butter-side down.

227
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:20,835
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine who's not a scientist,

228
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,973
for him to read and tell me what he thought,

229
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,075
and he took the chapter away.

230
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,308
He was working overseas.

231
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:30,309
I got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later,

232
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,542
and it said, "I'm at breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland,

233
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,298
and I really want to push toast off the table,

234
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,864
because I don't believe what you wrote."

235
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,203
And that was the good bit -- he doesn't have to.

236
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:45,683
He can push the toast off the table and try it for himself.

237
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:49,544
And so there's two important things to know about science:

238
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:53,882
the fundamental laws we've learned through experience and experimentation,

239
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,060
work.

240
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,066
The day we drop an apple and it goes up,

241
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,006
then we'll have a debate about gravity.

242
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,620
Up to that point, we basically know how gravity works,

243
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,178
and we can learn the framework.

244
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:05,489
Then there's the process of experimentation:

245
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:07,716
having confidence in things, trying things out,

246
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,209
critical thinking -- how we move science forward --

247
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,233
and you can learn both of those things

248
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,352
by playing with toys in the everyday world.

249
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,523
And it's really important,

250
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,762
because there's all this talk about technology,

251
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,787
we've heard talks about quantum computing

252
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,812
and all these mysterious, far-off things.

253
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:27,670
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies that are about this size,

254
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:30,631
we still walk about, sit on chairs that are about this size,

255
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,655
we still live in the physical world.

256
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,627
And being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless.

257
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:39,502
And I think it's really important that we're not helpless,

258
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:41,734
that society feels it can look at things,

259
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,424
because this isn't about knowing all the answers.

260
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:47,865
It's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions.

261
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,403
And by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life,

262
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,162
we gain the confidence to ask the right questions.

263
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,872
So, there's a bigger thing.

264
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,270
In answer to Nana's question

265
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,304
about what can you do when you know that --

266
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,781
because there's lots of stuff in the everyday world

267
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,502
that you can do when you know that,

268
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,980
especially if you've got eggs in the fridge --

269
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:08,326
there's a much deeper answer.

270
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,514
And so there's all the fun and the curiosity

271
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,500
that you could have playing with toys.

272
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,072
By the way -- why should kids have all the fun, right?

273
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,096
All of us can have fun playing with toys,

274
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.

275
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,022
You can blame me, it's fine.

276
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:27,455
So when it comes to reasons for studying physics, for example,

277
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,370
here is the best reason I can think of:

278
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:34,226
I think that each of us has three life-support systems.

279
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,607
We've got our own body, we've got a planet

280
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,398
and we've got our civilization.

281
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,461
Each of those is an independent life-support system,

282
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,485
keeping us alive in its own way.

283
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,676
And they all run on the fundamental physical laws

284
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,100
that you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and teacups and lemonade,

285
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:52,003
and everything else you can play with.

286
00:12:52,027 --> 00:12:53,628
This is the reason, for example,

287
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,557
why something like climate change is such a serious problem,

288
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,113
because It's two of these life-support systems,

289
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,905
our planet and our civilization,

290
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,884
kind of butting up against each other;

291
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,800
they're in conflict, and we need to negotiate that boundary.

292
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,340
And the fundamental physical laws that we can learn

293
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:10,544
that are the way the world around us works,

294
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,988
are the tools at the basis of everything;

295
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,374
they're the foundation.

296
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,569
There's lots of things to know about in life,

297
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:19,389
but knowing the foundations is going to get you a long way.

298
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:23,054
And I think this, if you're not interested in having fun with physics

299
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:27,129
or anything like that -- strange, but apparently, these people exist --

300
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:31,240
you surely are interested in keeping yourself alive

301
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,315
and in how our life-support systems work.

302
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:38,114
The framework for physics is remarkably constant;

303
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,814
it's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure.

304
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,676
It's not going to change anytime soon.

305
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,963
They might discover some new quantum mechanics,

306
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:47,643
but apples right here are still going to fall down.

307
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,790
So, the question is --

308
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,103
I get asked sometimes: How do you start?

309
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,348
What's the place to start

310
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:56,628
if you're interested in the physical world, in not being helpless,

311
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,489
and in finding some toys to play with?

312
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:00,917
Here is my suggestion to you:

313
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:06,340
the place to start is that moment -- and adults do this --

314
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:08,226
you're drifting along somewhere,

315
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,841
and you spot something and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird."

316
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:15,489
And then your consciousness goes, "You're an adult. Keep going."

317
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:18,352
And that's the point -- hold that thought --

318
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:21,004
that bit where your brain went, "Oh, that's a bit odd,"

319
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,081
because there's something there to play with,

320
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,823
and it's worth you playing with it,

321
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,243
so that's the place to start.

322
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,633
But if you don't have any of those little moments

323
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,253
on your way home from this event,

324
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:31,962
here are some things to start with.

325
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,148
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; highly entertaining.

326
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,172
Watch a coffee spill dry.

327
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:38,800
I know that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry,

328
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:42,289
but it does do quite weird things; it's worth watching.

329
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:46,508
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around.

330
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,972
There are so many things you can do to play with teacups, it's brilliant.

331
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:53,405
The most obvious one is to get a teacup, get a spoon,

332
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,747
tap the teacup around the rim and listen,

333
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,566
and you will hear something strange.

334
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,890
And the other thing is, push your toast off the table

335
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,323
because you can, and you'll learn stuff from it.

336
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,299
And if you're feeling really ambitious,

337
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:09,450
try and push it off in such a way that it doesn't fall butter-side down,

338
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,030
which is possible.

339
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:13,756
The point of all of this is that,

340
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,873
first of all, we should all play with toys.

341
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:19,321
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves

342
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:20,595
with the tools around us,

343
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,399
because we all have access to them.

344
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,042
It matters, because if we want to understand society,

345
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,625
if we want to be good citizens,

346
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,727
we need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based.

347
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,770
Playing with toys is great.

348
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,907
Understanding how to keep our life-support systems going is great.

349
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,324
But fundamentally, the thing that we need to change

350
00:15:38,348 --> 00:15:40,176
in the way that we talk about physics,

351
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,359
is we need to understand

352
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:43,699
that physics isn't out there with weird people

353
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,203
and strange hieroglyphics

354
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,849
for somebody else in a posh lab.

355
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:49,923
Physics is right here; it's for us, and we can all play with it.

356
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,113
Thank you very much.

357
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,137
