[528.33 528.58] it's
[528.58 528.82] my
[528.82 529.39] second
[529.39 529.61] big

[530.71 531.13] only
[531.13 531.84] created
[531.84 532.14] for

[535.09 535.31] right
[535.45 535.61] and
[535.61 535.97] this
[535.97 536.16] is
[536.16 536.56] literally
[536.56 536.79] how
[536.79 537.01] I
[537.01 537.4] work
[537.4 537.7] is
[537.7 537.86] I
[537.86 538.4] don't
[538.45 538.54] I

[540.82 540.94] for
[540.94 541.33] fun
Transcript 1:
[541.94 542.36] but
[542.39 542.56] I
[542.56 542.85] want

[543.25 543.37] for
[543.37 543.73] something
[543.73 544.31] meaningful
[544.31 544.56] so

[545.29 545.72] project
[545.72 545.88] I've

[820.34 820.47] it
[820.47 820.73] actually
[820.73 821.12] works
[821.12 821.39] really
[821.39 821.82] beautifully
[821.82 822.18] together
[822.36 822.49] and
[822.49 822.58] I
[822.58 822.85] actually
[822.85 823.16] think
[823.16 823.27] it
[823.27 823.54] works
[823.54 823.62] the
[823.62 823.9] same
[823.9 824.06] way
[824.06 824.3] you
[824.3 824.66] need
[824.66 824.77] to

Transcript 1:
[858.74 858.91] now
[858.91 859.13] when
[859.13 859.22] we
[859.22 859.39] talk
[859.39 859.55] let's
[859.55 859.66] say
[859.66 859.88] that
[859.88 860.0] you
[860.0 860.26] took
[860.26 860.39] out
[860.39 860.69] some
[860.72 860.92] some
[860.92 861.0] of
[861.0 861.09] the
[861.09 861.53] traits
[861.53 861.88] that
[861.91 862.24] that
[862.27 862.52] that
[862.58 862.74] you
[862.74 862.86] have
[862.86 863.01] which
[863.01 863.06] a
[863.06 863.45] hundred
[863.45 863.81] things
[863.81 863.95] this
[863.95 864.24] idea
[864.24 864.51] called
[864.51 865.05] taste
[865.05 865.15] and
[865.15 865.31] I
[865.31 865.56] just
[865.56 865.62] a
[865.62 865.83] couple
[865.83 865.92] of

[866.66 867.01] here
[867.04 867.17] now
[867.17 867.73] apparently
[868.06 868.3] I
[868.3 868.55] think
[868.55 868.74] this
[868.74 868.85] is
[868.85 868.93] an
[868.93 869.4] example
[869.4 869.56] of
[869.59 869.88] not
[869.88 870.36] ethically
[870.36 870.55] good

[874.41 874.72] better
[874.72 875.31] taste
[875.37 875.75] which
[875.75 876.07] as
[876.18 876.39] one
[876.39 876.51] can
[876.51 876.86] immediately
[876.86 877.17] see
[877.37 877.67] what
[877.67 877.79] is
[877.79 877.89] the
